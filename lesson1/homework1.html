            <p>The Simpsons (often shortened to Simpsons) is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for
                the Fox Broadcasting Company. The main characters are a satire of a working-class family, consisting of
                Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The series lampoons many aspects of American culture, society,
                politics, and history.

                The cartoon made its debut as 60-second animated bumpers for The Tracey Ullman Show, with the first
                short airing on April 19, 1987. The shorts were then expanded into a full-length 30-minute television
                spin-off by 20th Century Fox, first airing on December 17, 1989. As of 2021, 33 seasons have aired, with
                the 34th airing since September 25.

                The series currently holds the record for the longest-running prime-time sitcom in the US, running for
                32 years and 34 seasons, as well as three seasons of shorts since 1989, and becoming the longest-running
                program on FOX.</p>

            <p>Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and
                one of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.

                In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a
                train called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who
                exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's
                surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental
                involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding
                and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by
                those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on
                her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of
                Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to those who
                she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do
                whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary.
                Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things through.</p>
